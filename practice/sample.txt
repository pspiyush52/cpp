Just as order relations are grounded in ordered sets, sets closed under
pairwise supremum and infimum, equivalence relations are grounded in
partitioned sets, which are sets closed under bijections that preserve
partition structure. Since all such bijections map an equivalence class
onto itself, such bijections are also known as permutations. Hence
permutation groups (also known as transformation groups) and the related
notion of orbit shed light on the mathematical structure of equivalence
relations.
