Databases and database systems have become an essential part of our everyday life.
We encounter several activities that involve some interaction with a database almost
daily. The examples include deposit and/or withdrawal from a bank, hotel, airline or
railway reservation, accessing a computerised library, order a magazine subscription
from a publisher, purchase items from supermarkets. In all the above cases a database
is accessed. These may be called Traditional Database Applications. In these types
of databases, the information stored and accessed is textual or numeric. However, with
advances in technology in the past few years, different databases have been developed
such as Multimedia Databases that store pictures, video clips and sound messages;
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) that can store maps, weather data and
satellite images, etc., and Real time databases that can control industrial and
manufacturing processes. In this unit, we will be introducing the concepts involved in
the Database Management System.
